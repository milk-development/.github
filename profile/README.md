## FAQ

#### How did you came up with the name?

"In 2020, I had several game concepts in my head and I wanted to realize them. Since there was a quarantine, there was plenty of time, but I couldn't organize a suitable team from among the friends I knew at the time, and I was also working on several other projects and didn't find the time to quench my desire to create games. But as for the name, it was largely inspired by the content of [Dani](https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev), which was a great inspiration for me."

#### How was the team formed?

"The first signs of me and game development coming all together was in July 2023. At the time I was meeting with [Wateczny](https://www.github.com/Wateczny) on a daily basis, we were basically neighbors back then. And I loved that time when I was at his house, We would watch Neon Genesis Evangelion together, go on a walks and don't even get me started about spending the night together and playing games until the sun rises. It was the peak of our friendship, and that was that time when we both had our crazy game ideas, that both of us wanted to become true. Now going forward to February 2024 it was that time when I met [Halfieee](https://www.github.com/Halfieee), a person who changed my life completely. He also joined me and Wateczny on a adventure of making our dreams come true. Finally a friend of Halfieee, memento_m00ri joined us to help with pixel art and that was how we managed to get there." ~ [iodomi](https://www.github.com/iodomi)

#### What's your goal?
"Our main goal is to create quality games that appeal to many audiences. We try to give our products a nostalgic character while also putting our own spin on them. We strive to build a healthy relationship between the developers and the player base. As I like to say, "No game development studio can bloom without the critique from its fan base." We may have our ups and downs, but that doesn't mean we'll give up on creating fond memories for our players." ~ [Wateczny](https://www.github.com/Wateczny)
